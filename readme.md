File-based Object Cache is Utterly Slow: An Object Caching Dropin for WordPress that uses the local file system


## Description 
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/emrikol/focus.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/emrikol/focus)

I needed a persistent object cache while doing work on a budget hosting provider.  A lot of the other file-based caching plugins were either bundled with other things I didn't need (W3 Total Cache), or were old and broken.

I've been heavily influenced by [wp-redis](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/wp-redis), [W3 Total Cache](https://wordpress.org/plugins/w3-total-cache/), and [wp-memcached](https://github.com/Automattic/wp-memcached) to name a few.
